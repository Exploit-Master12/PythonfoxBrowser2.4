Behold:
The one and only,(well,not really,there are quite a few versions)
the umm..what was it called? ...Firefox-Python-Linux-Replit-Github browser!

1.Make a replit account.If you already have one,then skip to step 2 and
skip the lecture.
If you use google,or github.or any other media,
that's ok.If you are not smart enough to figure out how to 
make an account,then you should probably
***GETT OUTT OF MY REPOSITORY,YOU DUMB GIT!***  ...HUB? Github? AHHHHHHH YAAAAAYYYY

2.Go to 
```
https://replit.com/@viaangothivreka/Firefox-Unblock3r
```
and remix the project...and maybe hit the follow button.
Go to "console" to change or add some code,
but ***THIS IS ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING***

3.Click the tab in the second half of the screen
called "Webveiw" or "Output".
Make sure both tabs are there,the webveiw,and output one...
Now,wait until you see a webpage!
***YOU HAVE SET UP THE BROWSER!!*** =-)
Since extensions and wifi restrictions don't run here,
it is completely unblocked!

***-NOTES AND IMPORTANT INFO***
-Most of this code is written by me.=-P
-This browser is more unstable than a  one-legged man on a bicycle.
-If it shuts down for no reason,
go back to "Networking" tab and make sure never to 
close the "Main.sh" one.
-To restart it,if it stops working,
reload the site,(replit)
or **GO TO THE NETWORKING TAB**
and click the very small button 
that looks like a television or computer monitor,
that is right next to the subtitle that says "External Port".

Follow for more exploits,- Exploit-Master12 ðŸ™‚ =-)
